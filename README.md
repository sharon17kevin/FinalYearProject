# Crop Rotation Decision Support System (Final Year Project)
A machine learning-based decision support system designed to recommend optimal crop rotations based on soil parameters, using a Random Forest model. Developed as a final-year project to support sustainable agricultural practices through data-driven insights.

## Project Overview
Crop rotation plays a crucial role in maintaining soil health and boosting crop yield. This system leverages soil data to generate rotation recommendations, helping farmers choose crop sequences that optimize soil quality and reduce resource depletion.

## Features
1) Data-Driven Crop Rotation Recommendations: Suggests ideal crop rotations tailored to specific soil conditions.
2) Random Forest Model: A machine learning model that analyzes soil parameters and historical crop data to generate predictions.
3) User-Friendly Interface: Input soil parameters easily to receive crop rotation recommendations.
4) Sustainable Agriculture Support: Designed to promote soil health and minimize environmental impacts.
